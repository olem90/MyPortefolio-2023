      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I’m a 33-year-old front-end developer originally from Trondheim, Norway. 
        I recently completed my studies at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, 
        and I’m currently living in Madrid with my girlfriend. In October, we’ll be relocating to Oslo, 
        and I’m looking forward to the new opportunities that come with the move.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my time at Noroff, I developed a strong passion for web development—especially 
        working with modern frameworks and tools to create engaging, functional user experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that I’m stepping into the professional world, I’m excited to grow as a developer, 
        take on new challenges, and contribute to meaningful projects.
        I’m all about continuous learning, clean code, and building things that people enjoy using.
      </p>
