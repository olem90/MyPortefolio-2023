            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As a recent graduate from Noroff School of Technology 
                and Digital Media, I am actively pursuing opportunities in 
                front-end development. My educational journey has ignited a 
                passion for exploring and mastering various frameworks 
                and tools, enhancing my capabilities as a developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                At 33 years old, my roots are firmly planted in Trondheim, Norway, 
                where I was born and raised. However, my current residence is in Madrid, 
                where I live with my girlfriend and our two bunnies. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            I am eager to embark on my professional career, bringing a blend of technical 
            skill and enthusiasm to deliver solutions that meet and exceed client expectations. 
            My goal is to contribute meaningfully to projects, leveraging my knowledge and newfound  
            skills to create impactful digital experiences.
